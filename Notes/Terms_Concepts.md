# **Terms and Concepts**
- The goal of this file is to explain common terminology in space engineering etc. 


## MLI - Multi-Layer Insulation
- This is a type of thermal insulation used on spacecraft. It consists of multiple thin layers of reflective material (usually metallized plastic films) separated by low-conductivity spacers. MLI primarily reduces heat loss/gain by thermal radiation in vacuum (where convection and conduction are minimal). It's one of the most common passive thermal control methods for satellites, probes, and cryogenic systems

## OSR - Optical Solar Reflector
- specialized thermal control components used on spacecraft to manage temperature in the vacuum of space. They are essentially high-performance mirrors designed to reflect most incoming solar radiation (low solar absorptivity, α) while efficiently emitting heat as infrared radiation (high thermal emissivity, ε). This combination makes OSRs one of the best passive solutions for radiative cooling on satellites, probes, and orbital structures

## PET - Polyethylene Terephthalate
- A type of polyester film (commonly known by trade names like Mylar). It's used as a base substrate in MLI blankets because it's lightweight, strong, and can be easily metallized (e.g., aluminized) for high reflectivity. Pure PET has very low thermal emissivity, which is why it's often coated.

## FEP - Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene
- A fluoropolymer (a type of Teflon-like material) used as a coating or outer layer in MLI blankets. FEP is applied over metallized films (especially on the outer layers) for protection against atomic oxygen erosion, UV radiation, and environmental degradation in space. It has excellent thermal stability, low outgassing, and good optical properties (low solar absorptivity and high infrared emissivity in some configurations).
