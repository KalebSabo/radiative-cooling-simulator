# **Stefon-Boltzmann Law**

## Origin
- The law was empirically discovered by Josef Stefan (1879) and theoretically derived by Ludwig Boltzmann (1884) using classical thermodynamics.

## Statement
- The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a *Black Body* per unit time is proportional to the fourth power of its *absolute* temperature

    $ j = \sigma T^4 $

$j$ : Radiated power per unit area (in W/m², also called radiant exitance)

$\sigma$ : Stefan-Boltzmann constant = $5.670 \times 10^{-8}$ W·m⁻²·K⁻⁴

$T$ : Absolute temperature in Kelvin (K).

## Juxtaposition
- There is no material (yet) that is a *Perfect Black Body* (perfectly emit/absorb radiated power), thus the introduction of Emissivity into the equation. 

    $\epsilon $

- New Formula (imposing the *Real World*)

    $ j = \epsilon \sigma T^4 $

## Emissivity 
 - $ \epsilon = 1 $
    - A *perfect black body* (or absorber/emitter)
    - Is able to equally emit and absorb the maximum possible thermal radiation at a given temperature

- $ \epsilon = 0 $
    - A *perfect white body* (or reflector)
    - Is able to reflect all incoming radiation perfectly

- $ 0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1 $ 
    - Thus, emissivity of genuine, real world material should fall into this range. 

## Example Application
- In **SpaceX's Starship**, the *emissivity* of the black tiles (that are a close *perfect* black body ~0.9 $\epsilon$) prevents heating the steel interior (shiny white body) as it radiates nearly 500 kilowatts of energy per square meter out and away into space
    - essentially it is really close to shedding as much heat as it takes.
